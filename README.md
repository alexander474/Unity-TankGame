# Unity-TankGame

This is a Tank game that we did make as a unity exam and we had 2 weeks to make a game with a menu and quit function. This is what we came up with. 

This game do wee use varius assets and we made a functional Ai tank bots that can fight us.

# GamePlay

You start in one corner of the map and have to take out 4 enemie tanks and when you have killed those tanks a boss spawns. the boss is a lot harder too kill because he have 3 times the lives as the regular tanks.

LifeStats:
Player: 200
Enemie Tank: 100
Boss Tank: 300
